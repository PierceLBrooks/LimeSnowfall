Ludum Dare 48 - "Lime Snowfall"

You have discovered classified documents which reveal an extensively corrupt government conspiracy, but agents of the state have found you out as a whistleblower and are in pursuit to extrajudicially eliminate you! They have cut the cables of your escape route elevator and are rappelling down the shaft after the platform in free-fall. You must now defend yourself against these assailants, and stand for the public's right to know what atrocities have been committed in the name of "freedom." Holding onto the briefcase will kindle the flame of hope that justice will prevail, but the weight of its secrets will weigh you down significantly as you brave the storm of bullets that soon comes. Your trusty flashlight will help to illuminate threats looming within the darkness, and improves weapon accuracy as well.
